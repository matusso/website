Hi, I'm Matus Bursa. 

By day, I'm a cybersecurity engineer diving deep into the digital trenches—think ethical hacking, securing networks, and outsmarting threats before they strike. 
When I'm not fortifying firewalls, you'll find me geeking out over Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges or reliving the chaos of events like 38c3 and DEF CON 33, 
where I recently snagged some swag from the RFJ booth and celebrated the release of Phrack 72. 

### What Fuels My Engine ###
Beyond the code and exploits, I'm all about that high-octane life:

#### Formula 1 #### 
A die-hard fan since... well, forever. I live for the drama—whether it's Verstappen's clinical dominance, Hamilton's masterclass moves, or Leclerc's wild off-track adventures. 
Predictions? VER, RUS, NOR all the way. Catch me dissecting races with friends over coffee (or a race-day stream).

#### Adventure on Two (Three or Four) Wheels ####
Mountain biking (MTB) clears my head—nothing beats bombing down a trail after a long week. I'm also hooked on Japanese car culture  (JDM dreams) and Canadian trike vibes from Can-Am. 
If it's got wheels and horsepower, I'm in.

#### Music & Memes ####
Spotify playlists for every mood (shoutout to Tono Suchota for nailing it lately), 
and a weakness for clever YouTube shorts that blend tech, humor, and absurdity. Life's too short for boring feeds.

Let's build a better tomorrow, one witty takedown at a time.
### In a nutshell ### 
Part hacker, part racer, all enthusiast.
