Good afternoon to every security researcher. I would like to share my experience of finding announced vulnerability by internal F5 security team and writing the exploit for [CVE-2022-1388](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K23605346).

You can read more about this vulnerability on [thehackernews](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/f5-warns-of-new-critical-big-ip-remote.html) or [helpnetsecurity](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2022/05/09/cve-2022-1388-poc-exploitation/). [iControl REST](https://clouddocs.f5.com/api/icontrol-rest/) is an API for interaction between scripts and *F5 device*, used to manage and control that device automatically.  

Based on the details of the *mitigation*, the problem should be somewhere in the `Connection: ` header.

### mitigation
```apache
<If \"%{HTTP:connection} =~ /close/i \">
RequestHeader set connection close
</If>
<ElseIf \"%{HTTP:connection} =~ /keep-alive/i \">
RequestHeader set connection keep-alive
</ElseIf>
<Else>
    RequestHeader set connection close
</Else>
```

### inside the library

If we use `diff` and `strings` commands, we can see which strings were changed/added to the library, so I decided to download one from the vulnerable version `BIGIP-16.1.0-0.0.19` and one from the fixed version `BIGIP-16.1.2.2-0.0.28`

```bash
$ diff  <(strings mod_auth_pam.so_new ) <(strings mod_auth_pam.so_old)
...
259,261d243
< Connection
< close
< keep-alive
268d249
...
```

### header Connection

We know that in F5, there is `Jetty` server without authentication on `TCP/8100`, which we can hit for example from `localhost` (F5 device). We also know that there is `Apache` which does the *Authentication* for `Jetty`. We also know that we can abuse [hop-by-hop header](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/abusing-hop-by-hop-headers) there, but we don't know which header we should pass to the `Connection` header. For more details about hop-by-hop headers you can read [RFC2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-13.5.1)


### exploit

After couple of hours and tries I found the requirements to make the exploit functionable:
- `X-F5-Auth-Token` header must be present (that's a requirement for Apache sends request to Jetty backend)
- `Connection` header *must* include `X-F5-Auth-Token` (based on hop-by-hop headers this will delete `X-F5-Auth-Token` from the request sended to the backend)
- `Host` header *must* be `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` (Jetty either checks this value or you can put `X-Forwarded-Host` to `Connection` header to make `X-Forwarded-Host` header invisible for Jetty)
- `Authentication` header *must* be `admin` user

*curl*

That's all from my side, you can look at python [exploit](https://github.com/horizon3ai/CVE-2022-1388) from [Horizon3Attack team](https://twitter.com/Horizon3Attack) or read their [blog: F5 iControl REST vulnerability.](https://www.horizon3.ai/f5-icontrol-rest-endpoint-authentication-bypass-technical-deep-dive/)
